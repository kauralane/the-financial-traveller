# travel-research-app
Ellie, Billy and Laura's travel research app

## Overview
 This is the 1st Group Project of our bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. This project has provided us an opportunity to challenge ourselves to apply all of the knowledge we have gained so far in this bootcamp to produce an application that runs smoothly and looks pleasant to the user. The one area of coding that we hadn't traversed before completing this project was the group work aspect of coding. Completing this project has taught us all how to work collaboratively as front-end web developers, building on our skills of communication, attention to detail, and team work to achieve a finished product. 

## Description
This project involved designing an application that would fetch data from 2 different server-side APIs and display it for the user's convenience. We used bootstrap to form the main structure and style of our application with some additional CSS styling to create a design we as a group are content with. We have used Javascript and Jquery to dynamically create HTML elements and CSS styling, as well as create functions that help to ensure the application is interactive, responding in a way that lends to a more user friendly experience.
